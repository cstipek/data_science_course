    "If you're not familiar with the term **method** it refers to the fact that once you create an object, there are certain functions that you can call that are relevant to the object. For example, a set has a method called `difference` so that you can take the difference of one set from another set. To call the method, you type the name of the object itself, followed by a period, and the name of the method. Tab completion can help you find out what all methods an object might have. Similarly, on more sophisticated editors like Visual Studio Code, we can use intellisense to quickly view the methods and attributes of an object and even pull up their definitions. Finally, we can also call the `dir` function in Python for this. In the below example, notice how we drop methods that start with a double underscore (called \"dunder\" by Pythonistas) as these are the internal methods and we should avoid using them. A deeper discussion of this is out of the scope of this lesson."
